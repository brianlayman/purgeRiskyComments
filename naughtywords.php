// Rather than causing Google to associate my name with all 400 words on my list, I'll let you build your own list.
// The list should be formatted like this:
// $naughtWords[] = 'adult film star'; // Phrases are fine
// $naughtWords[] = 'alcohol'; // Partial matches do count and alcohol would also catch alcoholic.
// $naughtWords[] = ' ass '; // Note the spaces before and after. 'ass ' would catch 'class' and ' ass' would catch assistant 'ass' would catch both.
// $naughtWords[] = 'asswipe'; // This must be here because of the spaces in the previous line.
